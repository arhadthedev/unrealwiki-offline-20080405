<p>In 1996 there was Quake. And it was good. Nothing stood in its path, nothing could compare to it in any way. When Epic first announced their own competitive multiplayer FPS game building up on their inhouse Engine they had used for their incredibly successful single player FPS Unreal, most people didn't take them very seriously considering the giant fanbase of the Quake series.</p>
<p>UT developed by <a href="http://www.digitalextremes.com" class="external text" title="http://www.digitalextremes.com" rel="nofollow">Digital Extremes</a> was published in November 1999 by <a href="http://www.gtinteractive.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.gtinteractive.com/" rel="nofollow">GT Interactive</a> for PC and was later released for PS2, <a href="../../../../articles/l/i/n/Legacy%7ELinux_fdac.html" title="Legacy:Linux">Linux</a>, Dreamcast and <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/c/Legacy%7EMac_bcbb.html" title="Legacy:Mac">Mac</a>. Quake III was published around the same time but offered little new, whereas UT could offer multiple game modes from simple Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Domination, Last Man Standing to Assault, new Movement types (Dodging), more diverse weapons with multiple firing modes that could be combined, intelligent Bots, it could be modded easily and and could provide one thing most of all: FUN!!! (lots of it)</p>
<p>UT won several game of the year awards and a GOTY (Game Of The Year) Edition was released that contained additional free content like maps, skins, models etc. that the developers had released to the community before in the form of several free bonus packs. This development philosophy to improve and enhance the product with free bonus stuff has become characteristic of the UT series and was continued in the sequel of UT <a href="../../../../articles/u/t/2/Legacy%7EUT2003_f97b.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Legacy:UT2003">Unreal Tournament 2003</a> that was published in late 2002. It helped to build up the large Unreal community that today is stronger than ever before. Since the release of UT Quake and its successors have had to live under the ever growing shadow of the Unreal franchise.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reviews</span></h2>
<p>Read what <a href="http://pc.ign.com/" class="external text" title="http://pc.ign.com/" rel="nofollow">IGNPC</a> had to say about UT in their review 1999:</p>
<p>Unreal Tournament is getting the highest score that IGNPC has ever given a game. Simply put, Epic has earned it by delivering a title that is as close to flawless as I've ever seen, both in its ability to entertain and in its finely honed technology and presentation. While there's no doubt that Quake III is a powerfully addictive game with some advantages over Unreal, I feel like, in the long run, Unreal Tournament will be the better of the two games. Still, Tal is currently working on his Quake III review and you'll have to wait until next week to see our head-to-head comparison of the two games. In the end though, none of this really matters - this is a title that will keep you (and your friends) busy for a very long time to come. Go buy it.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Discussion</span></h3>
<p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> I think a bit more info would be nice</p>
<p><b>CH3Z:</b> Shaping up, but, "...was published in 2003. Some years later..." What year is it again?? =P</p>
<p><b>Nik:</b> I tried to give a history of UT from a historical point of view, my first ever wiki page, sorry CH3Z I still don't quite get the hang on this.&#160;:-)</p>
<p><b>Tarquin:</b> No worries, Nik. Welcome to the wiki&#160;:) Mistakes aren't a problem here, we correct each other's.</p>
<p><b>CH3Z:</b> Np Nik, thx for taking the initiative, I just didn't want to change it because I thought you might have more of an idea where you trying to take it then I had. Wanted to give you a welcome to Unreal Wiki in your personal page but I don't see it yet. Anyway, welcome aboard, Nik.&#160;:cool:</p>
<p><b>FragBait:</b> I Wouldn't Use Anything Below:</p>
<p>1 GHz processor, 256 MB Ram, and 1 GB free hard-disk space for all that stuff you download</p>
<p>(for those who haven't figured out im just kidding)</p>
<p><b>RDGDanClark:</b> A minor edit, I changed the release of UT2003 to "late 2002" &#160;:) Can you guys believe it's almost a year old?</p>
<p><b>Rasterbator:</b> How about a port to OS X for UnrealEd2? I have been wanting to create maps and textures, but really don't want to buy a Microsoft product (Virtual PC) to do it. I am running UT GOTY edition with 436 patch, and playing on OS X with the latest Beat Preview for OS X (no problems - runs just as well as in OS 9). Anybody know if this is being worked on?</p>
<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I don't think there's been any official word on this, however, I believe UnrealEd and the older builds of the engine are essentially unsupported by Epic now. To my knowledge, porting UCC and UnrealEd to Mac and Linux is a very low priority, but on the "eventual" list. However, when they do do so, I strongly suspect it will be the latest version of the editor that they port.</p>
<p><b>Dark Pulse:</b> I believe it's been said many a time that the older UnrealEd (Not sure of Version 3) had a lot of <i>x86</i> specific code and as such porting it would be a total pain in the ass. Of course, that's not to say someone couldn't do it... it'd just take a lot of time, a lot of headaches, and without a Code Dump, probably reverse-enginerring of some sort.</p>
<p><b>Slim:</b> There are a few rumours flying around and hitting people that suggest Epic are probably working on (or may be going to start working on) UED for OS 10. I've no idea if this is true or not. Probably not. Although it wouldn't surprise me if it was true since one of the main reasons UED never got released for the original Unreal Tournament was because of the porters of the mac version; Westlake Interactive. And since Epic took over the Mac production (go Epic) I suspected that it would get a lot more attention than it's predeccesor did. I've added a new page to put in some details about the <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/c/Legacy%7EMac_bcbb.html" title="Legacy:Mac">Mac</a> version too if that's okay.</p>
<p><b>El Muerte:</b> The new UnrealEd (4?) that comes with the UnrealEngine3 will be platform independed. Older versions of UnrealEd will never get a Mac (or Linux) port. The reason why UnrealEd 2 was never ported to Mac (or Linux) was because too much of its code base used win32 libraries (same goes for UnrealEd 3).</p>
<p><b>Slim:</b> I take back what I last said, since it appears <a href="http://beyondunreal.com/daedalus/singlepost.php?id=6277" class="external text" title="http://beyondunreal.com/daedalus/singlepost.php?id=6277" rel="nofollow">you are wrong</a> El Muerte&#160;;) (Thanks to Uncommon for the link). Well, wrong about there not being a Mac/Linux port of UnrealED for the new UnrealEngine3 anyway. Looks like the Mac is actually getting some attention after all these years... well... <i>Don't one hold your breath</i></p>
<p><b>El Muerte:</b> I'm not wrong, that link that you posted just confirms what I said. Don't mix up UnrealEd 3 and UnrealEngine3. UnrealEd 3 is part of UnrealEngine2 (what UT200x uses).</p>
<p><b>Slim:</b> Oh. Sorry I misunderstood the concept of "Platform Independant".</p>
<p><b>Evilmrfrank:</b> Maybe you shouldn't make the statement that Unreal Engine 2 is UT200x because UT2007 would also be considered 200x. And wasn't Digital Extremes more of a Co Creator of the game since it was pretty much Epic who created it mostly with the help of Digital Extremes.</p>
<p><b>Dark Pulse:</b> If you mean Unreal Tournament, then yes, it was a bit more of a co-creation (But about 65/35 DE I think.) UT2003 was mostly DE's project as well, and Epic basically got involved when they decided to port it to PC as UT2003. UT2004 was more of a Epic spearhead, though DE contributed some stuff, and there was also a lot of community stuff from guys like Teddie Tapawan and Hourences.</p>
<p>UT2007 will be nearly entirely Epic, as it seems that they and DE have since ceased on collaborating for Unreal Projects, and the lackluster sales of Pariah certainly didn't help. Perhaps Dark Sector will redeem them, but we won't see that for a year or two now. Epic has some big shoes to fill, as the general community consensus is DE made the better maps of the games.</p>
<p><b>Evilmrfrank:</b> Thats what I thought. Then shouldn't the statement under "Developer" be changed to include Epic?</p>
<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Removed To Do tag. I can't think of anything that needs work here.</p>
