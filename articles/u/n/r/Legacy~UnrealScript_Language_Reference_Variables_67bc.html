<h3><span class="mw-headline">Simple Variables</span></h3>
<p>Here are some examples of instance variable declarations in UnrealScript:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">int</span> a; <span class="co1">// Declare an integer variable named "A".</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">byte</span> Table<span class="br0">[</span><span class="nu0">64</span><span class="br0">]</span>; <span class="co1">// Declare an array of 64 bytes named "Table".</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">string</span><span class="br0">[</span><span class="nu0">32</span><span class="br0">]</span> PlayerName; <span class="co1">// Declare a max 32-character string.</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span> <a href="/Actor"><span class="kw10">actor</span></a> Other; <span class="co1">// Declare a variable referencing an actor.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Variables can appear in two kinds of places in UnrealScript: Instance variables, which apply to an entire object, appear immediately after the class declarations. Local variables appear within a function, and are only active while that function executes. Instance variables are declared with the "var" keyword. Local variables are declared with the "local" keyword.</p>
<p>Here are the basic variable types supported in UnrealScript:</p>
<dl>
<dt>byte&#160;</dt>
<dd>A single-byte value ranging from 0 to 255.</dd>
<dt>int&#160;</dt>
<dd>A 32-bit integer value.</dd>
<dt>bool&#160;</dt>
<dd>A boolean value: either "true" or "false".</dd>
<dt>float&#160;</dt>
<dd>A 32-bit floating point number.</dd>
<dt>string&#160;</dt>
<dd>A string of characters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>name&#160;</dt>
<dd>The name of an item in Unreal (such as the name of a function, state, class, etc). Names are stored as a 16-bit index into the global name table. Names correspond to simple strings of 1-31 characters. Names are not like strings: strings can be modified dynamically, but names can only take on predefined name values.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>enum&#160;</dt>
<dd>A variable that can take on one of several predefined name values. For example, the ELightType enumeration defined in the Actor script describes a dynamic light and takes on a value like LT_None, LT_Pulse, LT_Strobe, and so on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>struct&#160;</dt>
<dd>Similar to C structures, UnrealScript structs let you create new variable types that contain sub-variables. For example, two commonly-used structs are "vector", which consists of an X, Y, and Z component; and "rotator", which consists of a pitch, yaw, and roll component. Note that structs are passed by value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>object and actor references&#160;</dt>
<dd>A variable that refers to another object or actor in the world. For example, the Pawn class has an "Enemy" actor reference that specifies which actor the pawn should be trying to attack. Object and actor references are very powerful tools, because they enable you to access the variables and functions of another actor. For example, in the Pawn script, you can write "Enemy.Damage(123)" to call your enemy's Damage function – resulting in the enemy taking damage. Object references may also contain a special value called "None", which is the equivalent of the C "NULL" pointer: it says "this variable doesn't refer to any object".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Variables may also contain additional specifiers such as "const" that further describe the variable. Actually, there are quite a lot of specifiers which you wouldn't expect to see in a general-purpose programming language, mainly as a result of wanting UnrealScript to natively support many game- and environment-specific concepts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>const&#160;</dt>
<dd>Advanced. Treats the contents of the variable as a constant. In UnrealScript, you can read the value of const variables, but you can't write to them. "Const" is only used for variables which the engine is responsible for updating, and which can't be safely updated from UnrealScript, such as an actor's Location (which can only be set by calling the SetLocation or MoveActor functions).</dd>
<dt>editconst&#160;</dt>
<dd>Advanced. The variable can be seen in UnrealEd but not edited. A variable that is editconst is not implictly "const".</dd>
<dt>input&#160;</dt>
<dd>Advanced. Makes the variable accessible to Unreal's input system, so that input (such as button presses and joystick movements) can be directly mapped onto it. Only relevant with variables of type "byte" and "float".</dd>
<dt>transient&#160;</dt>
<dd>Advanced. Declares that the variable is for temporary use, and isn't part of the object's persistent state. Transient variables are not saved to disk. Transient variables are initialized to zero when an actor is loaded.</dd>
<dt>native&#160;</dt>
<dd>Advanced. Declares that the variable is loaded and saved by C++ code, rather than by UnrealScript.</dd>
<dt>private&#160;</dt>
<dd>The variable is private, and may only be accessed by the class's script; no other classes (including subclasses) may access it.</dd>
<dt>travel&#160;</dt>
<dd>Advanced. "Travel" is supported only for the player's <a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Legacy%7EPlayerPawn_5d98.html" title="Legacy:PlayerPawn">PlayerPawn</a> derived class and Inventory-derived classes in his linked Inventory list. It means "this variable should be saved and restored when switching levels, so that it isn't forgotten". This is the mechanism that keeps your health and ammo counts intact when switching levels. The combination of "transient" and "travel" isn't sensible (and isn't used in Unreal), since transient objects are non persistent between savegames, and "travel" implies the thing should persist between levels.</dd>
<dt>skip&#160;</dt>
<dd>Advanced. Only used for logical operators like &amp;&amp; and ||. (More details only available for Unreal licensees.)</dd>
<dt>export&#160;</dt>
<dd>Advanced. Only meaningful for the <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/u/Legacy%7EBrush_03bb.html" title="Legacy:Brush">Brush</a> variable in <a href="../../../../articles/a/c/t/Legacy%7EActor_5985.html" title="Legacy:Actor">Actor</a> classes. (More details only available for Unreal licensees.)</dd>
</dl>
<p><a name="Arrays" id="Arrays"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Arrays</span></h3>
<p>Arrays are declared using the following syntax:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">int</span> MyArray<span class="br0">[</span><span class="nu0">20</span><span class="br0">]</span>; <span class="co1">// Declares an array of 20 ints.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>UnrealScript supports only single-dimensional arrays, though you can simulate multidimensional arrays by carrying out the row/column math yourself. For information on Dynamic Arrays, see below in the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/r/Legacy%7EUnrealScript_Language_Reference_Advanced_Language_Features_c000.html" title="Legacy:UnrealScript Language Reference/Advanced Language Features">Legacy:UnrealScript Language Reference/Advanced Language Features</a> section.</p>
<p><a name="Editability" id="Editability"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Editability</span></h3>
<p>In UnrealScript, you can make an instance variable "editable", so that users can edit the variable's value in UnrealEd. This mechanism is responsible for the entire contents of the "Actor Properties" dialog in UnrealEd: everything you see there is simply an UnrealScript variable, which has been declared editable.</p>
<p>The syntax for declaring an editable variable is as follows:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw5">var</span><span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span> <span class="kw4">int</span> MyInteger; <span class="co1">// Declare an editable integer in the default</span>
                     <span class="co1">// category.</span>
 
<span class="kw5">var</span><span class="br0">(</span>MyCategory<span class="br0">)</span> <span class="kw4">bool</span> MyBool; <span class="co1">// Declare an editable bool in</span>
                             <span class="co1">// "MyCategory".</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can also declare a variable as "editconst", which means that the variable should be visible but not editable UnrealEd. Note that this only prevents the variable from being changed in the editor, not in script. If you want a variable that is truly "const" but still visible in the editor, you must declare it "const editconst":</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="co1">// MyBool is visible but not editable in UnrealEd</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span><span class="br0">(</span>MyCategory<span class="br0">)</span> <span class="kw6">editconst</span> <span class="kw4">bool</span> MyBool;
 
<span class="co1">// MyBool is visible but not editable in UnrealEd and</span>
<span class="co1">// not changeable in script</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span><span class="br0">(</span>MyCategory<span class="br0">)</span> <span class="kw5">const</span> <span class="kw6">editconst</span> <span class="kw4">bool</span> MyBool;
</pre></div>
<p><a name="Object_and_actor_reference_variables" id="Object_and_actor_reference_variables"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Object and actor reference variables</span></h3>
<p>You can declare a variable that refers to an actor or object like this:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw5">var</span> <a href="/Actor"><span class="kw10">actor</span></a> A; <span class="co1">// An actor reference.</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span> <a href="/Pawn"><span class="kw10">pawn</span></a> P; <span class="co1">// A reference to an actor in the Pawn class.</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span> <a href="/Texture"><span class="kw10">texture</span></a> T; <span class="co1">// A reference to a texture object.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The variable "P" above is a reference to an actor in the Pawn class. Such a variable can refer to any actor that belongs to a subclass of Pawn. For example, P might refer to a Brute, or a Skaarj, or a Manta. It can be any kind of Pawn. However, P can never refer to a Trigger actor (because Trigger is not a subclass of Pawn).</p>
<p>One example of where it's handy to have a variable referring to an actor is the Enemy variable in the Pawn class, which refers to the actor that the Pawn is trying to attack.</p>
<p>When you have a variable that refers to an actor, you can access that actor's variables, and call its functions. For example:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="co1">// Declare two variables that refer to a pawns.</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span> <a href="/Pawn"><span class="kw10">pawn</span></a> P, Q;
 
<span class="co1">// Here is a function that makes use of P.</span>
<span class="co1">// It displays some information about P.</span>
<span class="kw5">function</span> MyFunction<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span>
<span class="br0">{</span>
   <span class="co1">// Set P's enemy to Q.</span>
   P.<span class="me1">Enemy</span> = Q;
 
   <span class="co1">// Tell P to play his running animation.</span>
   P.<span class="me1">PlayRunning</span><span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span>;
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Variables that refer to actors always either refer to a valid actor (any actor that actually exists in the level), or they contain the value "None". None is equivalent to the C/C++ "NULL" pointer. However, in UnrealScript, it is safe to access variables and call functions with a "None" reference; the result is always zero.</p>
<p>Note that an object or actor reference "points to" another actor or object, it doesn't "contain" an actor or object. The C equivalent of an actor reference is a pointer to an object in the AActor class (in C, you'd say an AActor*). For example, you could have two monsters in the world, Bob and Fred, who are fighting each other. Bob's "Enemy" variable would "point to" Fred, and Fred's "Enemy" variable would "point to" Bob.</p>
<p>Unlike C pointers, UnrealScript object references are always safe and infallible. It is impossible for an object reference to refer to an object that doesn't exist or is invalid (other than the special-case "None" value). In UnrealScript, when an actor or object is destroyed, all references to it are automatically set to "None".</p>
<p><a name="Class_Reference_Variables" id="Class_Reference_Variables"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Class Reference Variables</span></h3>
<p>In Unreal, classes are objects just like actors, textures, and sounds are objects. Class objects belong to the class named "class". Now, there will often be cases where you'll want to store a reference to a class object, so that you can spawn an actor belonging to that class (without knowing what the class is at compile-time). For example:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw5">var</span><span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span> <span class="kw5">class</span> C;
<span class="kw5">var</span> <a href="/Actor"><span class="kw10">actor</span></a> A;
A = Spawn<span class="br0">(</span> C <span class="br0">)</span>; <span class="co1">// Spawn an actor belonging to some arbitrary class C.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now, be sure not to confuse the roles of a class C, and an object O belonging to class C. To give a really shaky analogy, a class is like a pepper grinder, and an object is like pepper. You can use the pepper grinder (the class) to create pepper (objects of that class) by turning the crank (calling the Spawn function)... <b>but,</b> a pepper grinder (a class) is not pepper (an object belonging to the class), so you <b>must not try to eat it!</b></p>
<p>When declaring variables that reference class objects, you can optionally use the special class&lt;classlimiter&gt; syntax to limit the variable to only containing references to classes which extend a given superclass. For example, in the declaration:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw5">var</span> class&lt;actor&gt; ActorClass;
</pre></div>
<p>The variable ActorClass may only reference a class that extends the "actor" class. This is useful for improving compile-time type checking. For example, the Spawn function takes a class as a parameter, but only makes sense when the given class is a subclass of Actor, and the class&lt;classlimiter&gt; syntax causes the compiler to enforce that requirement.</p>
<p>As with dynamic object casting, you can dynamically cast classes like this:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
class&lt;actor&gt;<span class="br0">(</span> SomeFunctionCall<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span> <span class="br0">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p><a name="Enumerations" id="Enumerations"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Enumerations</span></h3>
<p>Enumerations exist in UnrealScript as a convenient way to declare variables that can contain "one of" a bunch of keywords. For example, the actor class contains the enumeration EPhysics which describes the physics which Unreal should apply to the actor. This can be set to one of the predefined values like PHYS_None, PHYS_Walking, PHYS_Falling, and so on.</p>
<p>Internally, enumerations are stored as byte variables. In designing UnrealScript, enumerations were not seen as a necessity, but it makes code so much easier to read to see that an actor's physics mode is being set to "PHYS_Swimming" than (for example) "3".</p>
<p>Here is sample code that declares enumerations.</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="co1">// Declare the EColor enumeration, with three values.</span>
<span class="kw4">enum</span> EColor
<span class="br0">{</span>
       CO_Red,
       CO_Green,
       CO_Blue
<span class="br0">}</span>;
 
<span class="co1">// Now, declare two variables of type EColor.</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span> EColor ShirtColor, HatColor;
 
<span class="co1">// Alternatively, you can declare variables and</span>
<span class="co1">// enumerations together like this:</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">enum</span> EFruit
<span class="br0">{</span>
       FRUIT_Apple,
       FRUIT_Orange,
       FRUIT_Bannana
<span class="br0">}</span> FirstFruit, SecondFruit;
</pre></div>
<p>In the Unreal source, we always declare enumeration values like LT_Steady, PHYS_Falling, and so on, rather than as simply "Steady" or "Falling". This is just a matter of programming style, and is not a requirement of the language.</p>
<p>UnrealScript only recognizes unqualified enum tags (like FRUIT_Apple) in classes where the enumeration was defined, and in its subclasses. If you need to refer to an enumeration tag defined somewhere else in the class hierarchy, you must "qualify it":</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
FRUIT_Apple <span class="co1">// If Unreal can't find this enum tag...</span>
EFruit.<span class="me1">FRUIT_Apple</span> <span class="co1">// Then qualify it like this.</span>
</pre></div>
<p><a name="Structs" id="Structs"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Structs</span></h3>
<p>An UnrealScript struct is a way of cramming a bunch of variables together into a new kind of super-variable called a struct. UnrealScript structs are just like C structs, in that they can contain any simple variables or arrays.</p>
<p>You can declare a struct as follows:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="co1">// A point or direction vector in 3D space.</span>
 
<span class="kw4">struct</span> <span class="kw4">Vector</span>
<span class="br0">{</span>
       <span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">float</span> X;
       <span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">float</span> Y;
       <span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">float</span> Z
<span class="br0">}</span>;
</pre></div>
<p>Once you declare a struct, and only after you have declared it, you are ready to start declaring specific variables of that struct type:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="co1">// Declare a bunch of variables of type Vector.</span>
<span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">Vector</span> Position;
<span class="kw5">var</span> <span class="kw4">Vector</span> Destination;
</pre></div>
<p>To access a component of a struct, use code like the following.</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw5">function</span> MyFunction<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span>
<span class="br0">{</span>
       <span class="kw5">Local</span> <span class="kw4">Vector</span> A, B, C;
 
       <span class="co1">// Add some vectors.</span>
       C = A + B;
 
       <span class="co1">// Add just the x components of the vectors.</span>
       C.<span class="me1">X</span> = A.<span class="me1">X</span> + B.<span class="me1">X</span>;
 
       <span class="co1">// Pass vector C to a function.</span>
       SomeFunction<span class="br0">(</span> C <span class="br0">)</span>;
 
       <span class="co1">// Pass certain vector components to a function.</span>
       OtherFunction<span class="br0">(</span> A.<span class="me1">X</span>, C.<span class="me1">Z</span> <span class="br0">)</span>;
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can do anything with Struct variables that you can do with other variables: you can assign variables to them, you can pass them to functions, and you can access their components.</p>
<p>There are several Structs defined in the Object class which are used throughout Unreal. You should become familiar with their operation, as they are fundamental building blocks of scripts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Vector&#160;</dt>
<dd>A unique 3D point or vector in space, with an X, Y, and Z component.</dd>
<dt>Plane&#160;</dt>
<dd>Defines a unique plane in 3D space. A plane is defined by its X, Y, and Z components (which are assumed to be normalized) plus its W component, which represents the distance of the plane from the origin, along the plane's normal (which is the shortest line from the plane to the origin).</dd>
<dt>Rotator&#160;</dt>
