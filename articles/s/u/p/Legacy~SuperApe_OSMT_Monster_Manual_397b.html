<h2><span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p><i><b>Note: This is a reference for creatures found in <a href="../../../../articles/s/u/p/Legacy%7ESuperApe_Old_Skool_Monsta_Toolz_5e52.html" title="Legacy:SuperApe/Old Skool Monsta Toolz">Old Skool Monsta Toolz</a>. This is</b> not <b>meant to be a redefinition of the old Unreal or UT creatures. Do not edit this page to make the information fit old Unreal.</b></i></p>
<p>As a Level Designer, you need to know as much as possible about the monster you're placing in your map. Maybe you're devising the monster placement and want to know what monster is best for this situation. Perhaps you just want to know what's possible with these monsters. This reference is here to help guide your design decisions.</p>
<p>First listed is the ScriptedMonster Basics, the properties and orders available to all OSMT creatures, the ScriptedMonster classes. After that, individual creatures and their properties, behaviors and orders are listed.</p>
<p>While many of these creature classes mimic old UT monster classes, they are not meant to duplicate them. There are significant differences between classic UT creatures and OSMT creatures, despite the many similarities. Several new behaviors, properties and orders have been added to these creatures. The wiki page links are provided purely for reference.</p>
<p><a name="ScriptedMonster_Basics" id="ScriptedMonster_Basics"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">ScriptedMonster Basics</span></h2>
<p>ScriptedMonster is the base class for all the creatures in the OSMT toolset. Along with a custom Controller class, ScriptedMonsterController, it handles all the advanced AI features that were handled by the ScriptedPawn class from UT. ScriptedMonster is meant to be the accessible class the mapper modifies to tweak the individual creature properties to suit the needs of their map.</p>
<p>Additionally, note that if you would like to add your own custom monster at some point, subclass ScriptedMonster and make use of the functions available in this class and the functions used in other ScriptedMonster subclasses for easy development and integration to this toolset.</p>
<p><a name="Properties" id="Properties"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Properties</span></h3>
<p>Along with the normal Pawn and xPawn attributes, ScriptedMonsters have several new properties to help configure the creature's behavior. Most of these properties are used the same way as they were in UT.</p>
<p><a name="AI" id="AI"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">AI</span></h4>
<dl>
<dt>Aggressiveness&#160;</dt>
<dd>A ranking of how aggressive this creature is, generally between -1.0 and 1.0.</dd>
<dt>AttitudeToPlayer&#160;</dt>
<dd>A setting that defines the creature's behavior toward human players at map start. Creatures react to each other as defined by their species.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>ATTITUDE_Fear&#160;: This creature will try to flee from players.</li>
<li>ATTITUDE_Hate&#160;: This creature will attack players.</li>
<li>ATTITUDE_Frenzy&#160;: This creature will fight players to the end and never flee. It is a little less accurate and tends not to change Enemies.</li>
<li>ATTITUDE_Threaten&#160;: This creature will make hostile motions but will wait for the player to initiate combat.</li>
<li>ATTITUDE_Ignore&#160;: This creature will ignore players.</li>
<li>ATTITUDE_Friendly&#160;: This creature will not attack players. If possible, this creature may greet the player.</li>

<dt>bDropOnlyOne&#160;</dt>
<dd>If True, the creature can only drop one of the items listed in the GoodieDrop property array when it dies. The item is picked randomly.</dd>
<dt>bFixedStart&#160;</dt>
<dd>If True, this creature will not be moved from its placed location. Some Orders (like Patroling and Ambushing) use this property to determine if the creature should be moved directly to a related AI actor location at map start.</dd>
<dt>bHateWhenTriggered&#160;</dt>
<dd>If True, this creature will Hate (ATTITUDE_Hate) the player when triggered.</dd>
<dt>bIgnoreFriends&#160;</dt>

<dd>If True and if part of a team, this creature will command others with a matching TeamTag.</dd>
<dt>FirstHatePlayerEvent&#160;</dt>
<dd>This Event is fired when this creature first encounters a player it Hates.</dd>
<dt>GoodieDrop&#160;</dt>
<dd>A dynamic list of Pickups this creature will drop when it dies.</dd>
<dt>HearingThreshold&#160;</dt>
<dd>This is actually a standard Pawn property. It determines the relative threshold the creature will hear Enemies. It translates to a distance the creature can react to sounds, lower threshold being longer distance.</dd>
<dt>Intelligence&#160;</dt>
<dd>A setting that defines the relative intelligence (memory, tactics, etc.) of this creature.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>BRAINS_None&#160;: Amoeba-like. Only reacts to immediate stimulus.</li>
<li>BRAINS_Reptile&#160;:</li>
<li>BRAINS_Mammal&#160;:</li>
<li>BRAINS_Human&#160;: Player-like. Advanced tactics.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>SightRadius&#160;</dt>
<dd>This is actually a standard Pawn property. It determines the distance in UU that the creature will be able to see Enemies.</dd>
<dt>Skill&#160;</dt>
<dd>A ranking of how well this creature performs in combat. This property affects aim, movement speed, dodging ability, etc. If zero, the creature will be given the configured game Skill level. If more than zero, this value is added to the configured game Skill level, up to a maximum of 7 (equalling "Godlike").</dd>
<dt>TeamTag&#160;</dt>
<dd>A name given to the team which this creature belongs.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a name="Gib" id="Gib"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Gib</span></h4>
<dl>
<dt>GibScale&#160;</dt>
<dd>A DrawScale multiplier given to gibs spawned from this creature.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a name="Orders" id="Orders"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Orders</span></h4>
<dl>
<dt>AlarmTag&#160;</dt>
<dd>This creature is associated with AlarmPoints with this Tag. It will begin to perform their Alarm procedures when it first sees a player.</dd>
<dt>Orders&#160;</dt>
<dd>Determines this creature's initial state and commanded tasks. Typical Orders available to all creatures are: Ambushing, Guarding, Patroling, and Waiting. Some creatures have unique Orders available as well.</dd>
<dt>OrderTag&#160;</dt>
<dd>This Tag further identifies an actor for the creature to act its Orders upon. An Ambushing creature will ambush from an AmbushPoint with a matching Tag, a Guarding creature will guard the actor with a matching Tag, a Patroling creature will begin its patrol route at the PatrolPoint with a matching Tag.</dd>
<dt>SharedAlarmTag&#160;</dt>
<dd>If multiple creatures are to use the same AlarmTag, set that Tag here so that only one of the creatures perform the Alarm behaviors.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a name="Main_.28ScriptedMonster.29" id="Main_.28ScriptedMonster.29"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Main (ScriptedMonster)</span></h4>
<dl>
<dt>OddsOfAppearing&#160;</dt>
<dd>The chance this creature will show up at map start. Default = 1.0 (or 100%) This chance is adjusted by game Skill level.</dd>
<dt>StartingAnim&#160;</dt>
<dd>The name of the animation sequence to loop at map start.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a name="Sound" id="Sound"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Sound</span></h4>
<dl>
<dt>Acquire&#160;</dt>
<dd>The sound made when this creature acquires an Enemy.</dd>
<dt>Fear&#160;</dt>
<dd>The sound made when this creature is frightened.</dd>
<dt>Roam&#160;</dt>
<dd>The sound made when this creature is roaming or wandering.</dd>
<dt>Threaten&#160;</dt>
<dd>The sound made when this creature is threatening an Enemy.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a name="Orders_2" id="Orders_2"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Orders</span></h3>
<p>These Orders are behavior states available to all ScriptedMonster classes. By setting the Orders string property to these keywords, the creature will follow a set of rules governing their behavior. In addition to these standard available Orders, many creatures have individual Orders unique to their class. Check the creature class definitions below for available Orders unique to that class.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Waiting&#160;</dt>
<dd>(default) Wander or Camp nearby the placed spot until an Enemy is detected. Attack and freely roam afterwards.</dd>
<dt>Ambushing&#160;</dt>
<dd>Travel to an AmbushPoint (or spawn at one at map start) whose Tag matches OrderTag, wait for an Enemy, then Attack. Find an AmbushPoint again after combat and wait for another player.</dd>
<dt>Guarding&#160;</dt>
<dd>Guard an actor whose Tag matches OrderTag. Remain near and return to the placed spot after combat.</dd>
<dt>Patroling&#160;</dt>
<dd>Travel from one PatrolPoint (or spawn at one at map start), whose Tag matches OrderTag, to the NextPatrol in a series, leave for combat and return to patrol afterward.</dd>
<dt>Pose&#160;</dt>
<dd>This auxilliary Order is available to all ScriptedMonsters. It will force the creature to remain in place and loop it's StartingAnim sequence. The creature will not react to players or game events, so it is mostly used for non-game releated purposes, like taking screenshots, matinee cutscenes or decoration.</dd>
</dl>
<p><a name="Useful_Functions" id="Useful_Functions"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Useful Functions</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>A monster who dies will automatically trigger its Event. This can be used in a variety of situations where the mapper will require things to happen once the monster is dead, or to wait for things to happen until the monster had died. To set this up, the mapper will match the monster's Event to the Tag of some other triggerable actor. The player who kills the monster is considered the Instigator of the Event.</li>
<li>A monster who is triggered in some way where the Instigator of the trigger Event is a Pawn (Player or otherwise), will immediately become aware of the Pawn and consider the Pawn their Enemy. To set this up, the mapper will match the monster's Tag to the Event of some trigger system (trigger, Mover, another monster, etc.) where the player will cause (or Instigate) the Event.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Nalicow is a herd animal that was raised by the Nali, the oppressed race that players saved in the original Unreal game. Nalicows are harmless. They walk around, moo, shake, and sometimes poop a green blob that eventually "pops" in green smoke. Sometimes Nalicows are accompanied by BabyCows, which will usually stay close. If hurt, the Nalicow tends to turn away from the attacker and run.</p>

<p>The Fly is a large flying insect with little (no) intelligence. It will buzz as it flies. It crawls and flies until an Enemy is found. It will generally home in on the Enemy by flying because it flies much faster than it crawls, but when close it will usually land and attack from the ground, as it's ground attack can be made more frequently. If hit, the Fly will usually try to dodge by flying. Although a single Fly can be easy to defeat, swarms of Flies can be very challenging. When found in a swarm, Flies are sometimes known to alert the rest of the hive, if angered, causing the entire hive to attack at once.</p>

<p>Krall are fairly intelligent reptilian creatures long ago enslaved to serve the Skaarj. They have since become integrated into the Skaarj society as lower class soldiers. They are very loyal and are generally given more important duties than Brutes, like Patroling and Guarding. Krall are very agile; able to run quickly and jump very far. Krall carry a bladed staff which fires a yellow enegy bolt, so it can be used in close range as well as long. They have various striking melee attacks, both one handed and two handed. One two-handed attack is called a Pound, as the staff is brought down from over the Krall's head. Another two-handed attack is called a Throw, as the target is stabbed with the staff and then lifted and tossed backwards at the same time. Krall can also fire their projectile rapidly while standing in place, or at a slower rate as they walk towards their Enemy. Krall have nimble legs, but those legs are vulnerable to damage. Krall are able to loose their legs completely during combat and still put up a good fight by crawling and firing with their staff weapon. Krall are sometimes found sleeping (sometimes even while standing against a wall), but they are still fairly aware while asleep. Krall can be mischievious at times as well. They like to play dice games while on duty and are often found in groups of 2 to 8 sitting in a circle playing. They are slightly less aware than normal while they concentrate on their games.</p>

<p>Skaarj are highly intelligent and aggressive creatures that appear as a cross between a bipedal reptile and insect. They are strong and agile, able to run, dodge, and jump just like players do. They carry two large blades on each forearm that can retract. These blades can be used in a "One-Two" punch-style Claw melee attack or in a slashing Spin attack. Skaarj can also quickly Lunge at a target with both blades outstretched. On top of this, Skaarj have a natural bio-electrical charge they can build up and discharge as a projectile from each arm. These projectiles move quickly, do a fair amount of damage and cause the target to be thrown backwards. They can fire two projectiles at a time while standing still or at a slower rate while walking or jogging toward their Enemy. Skaarj are complex creatures, not only managing a variety of lesser creatures to do their bidding, but also comprising several classes within their species that handle various tasks. Skaarj are sometimes seen operating complex machinery or control panels. Skaarj are known to lie in wait, feigning death to catch a passing Enemy by suprise.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Description &amp; Behavior</span></h3>
<p>The Warlord is a Skaarj who has evolved through metamorphosis to the smartest, toughest and most dangerous creature. Warlords appear as giant Skaarj (like SkaarjBerserkers) with bat-like wings, very heavy armor and horns. Instead of using its blades or bio-electrical projectiles, the Walord has a special device fitted on its arm. It is a combonation rocket launcher and teleportation device. The rocket launcher fires homing rockets, able to lock onto the target and home in with moderate agility. The Warlord is able to use its rocket launcher as a club in close combat, but at distances, will fire two shots in quick succession. The Warlord can fire while walking toward its target or while flying. Warlords are moderately agile for their size, able to dodge projectile fire while walking or running. In the air, Warlords are extreamely agile, so they often prefer to be air born. For this reason, Warlords are typically found in more open spaces. If injured during combat, Warlords may use their teleportation device to retreat or to suprise their Enemy by appearing behind them. If hunting their Enemy, Warlords may use their teleportation device to "jump ahead", to close the gap on their Enemy, or to search around the area quickly. If seriously injured Warlords have been known to use the teleportation device to retreat from the battle altogether, laughing as they do so, to live and fight another day. If killed while flying, the Warlord will likely fall upside down to the ground and if the Enemy is still in sight, it will raise its rocket launcher to fire off one last "death shot" at them before dying. The Warlord is considered a Boss, so other creatures will avoid getting into combat with it.</p>

<dt>Mutilating&#160;</dt>
<dd>This special Order will cause this Warlord to be busy at map start mutilating a long dead carcass, by kicking it, hitting it and periodically ripping pieces of it off to eat it. The Warlord is slightly distracted and less aware while mutilating. When an Enemy is detected, the Warlord will laugh at them and then attack. A large gib is automatically spawned in front of the Warlord, so there is no need for the mapper to supply this gib. The gib will automatically disappear a short time after the Warlord has left to attack an Enemy.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Description &amp; Behavior</span></h3>
<p>ScriptedCharacters are player character Monsters. They look, sound and fight similar to normal Players. They may appear as any Player character. Most of the time, they will be friendly to Players and fight by their side, but these characters sometimes are held hostage, ignore Players or turn against Players and command legions of Monsters. Although they cannot pickup items, ScriptedCharacters attack by using up the weapon pickups they have in their inventory, so their attacks and damage vary depending on the weapon used. Once a weapon is depleated of ammo, they will switch to another weapon until their inventory is empty. ScriptedCharacters are very talkative. They will Taunt, Challenge and Cheer.</p>
