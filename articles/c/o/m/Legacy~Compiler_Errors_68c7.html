<h2><span class="mw-headline">Warnings</span></h2>
<dl>
<dt>Warning, '<i>name</i>' obscures '<i>name</i>' defined in base class&#160;</dt>
<dd>You declared a class variable, struct or enum with the same name as a class variable, struct or enum of a superclass. This will obscure the object in the superclass so you can't access it in the code of your class anymore.<br />
In UT2004 this warning also applies to local function variables which obscure class variables in the same class or one of its superclasses.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Could you get around this by simply using Self.? IE, if variable A was obscured by local variable A, you should be able to access local A with A, and global A with Self.A. Seems like it would work.</p>
<p><b>Wormbo:</b> Of course you could, but the warning is there because the usual way to access the class varaible is blocked. It's easier to find the problem with this warning when you access the obscuring variable instead of the obscured one in you code.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Warning, '<i>variable name</i>' - unreferenced local variable&#160;</dt>
<dd>A function declares a local variable but doesn't use it beyond that â€“ you may as well remove it if <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt" class="extiw" title="wiki:YouArentGonnaNeedIt">Wiki:YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Warning, <i>function name</i> - Missing return value&#160;</dt>
<dd>The function is declared as returning a value, but there's no <b>return</b> statement in the function. The default value of that variable type will be returned (e.g. false, 0, "", None; also see <a href="../../../../articles/v/a/r/Legacy%7EVariable_Syntax_b9c7.html" title="Legacy:Variable Syntax">Variable Syntax</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>ExecWarning, Reference to deprecated property '<i>variable name</i>'&#160;</dt>
<dd>You are using a variable marked as deprecated in your code.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Warning, Class names shouldn't end in a digit</dt>
<dd>This warning appears harmless enough. Classes with names ending in a digit (IE BloodFX2) seem to work fine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Warning, Missing Function&#160;</dt>
<dd>You are calling a function that has not been defined.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Bad class definition '<i>class name</i>'&#160;</dt>
<dd>In <a href="../../../../articles/u/t/2/Legacy%7EUT2003_f97b.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Legacy:UT2003">UT2003</a>, the most common cause for this error is that you accidentally used "expands" instead of "extends." The old keyword "expands" is not supported anymore. (It has been considered deprecated for a long while already.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Superclass <i>class name</i> of class <i>other class name</i> not found&#160;</dt>
<dd>The superclass of one of your classes couldn't be found. Check the class header of the second class for typos. If the superclass is in the same package also check its class header, if not check the <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/m/Legacy%7EGame_Ini_File_0242.html" title="Legacy:Game Ini File">Game Ini File</a>'s EditPackages lines for missing packages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Unexpected end of file at end of class&#160;</dt>
<dd>This is usually caused by one or more missing "<code>}</code>". This error can be quite annoying in large classes. Most of it is prevented by proper code indentation and (what experienced coders frequently do) writing <i>both</i> the opening and the closing brace at the same time and then filling in code between them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Unexpected 'defaultproperties'&#160;</dt>
<dd>The <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/f/Legacy%7EDefault_Properties_bc11.html" title="Legacy:Default Properties">default properties</a> block can only be used outside of <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/r/Legacy%7EUnrealEd_0d00.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Legacy:UnrealEd">UnrealEd</a>. Within UnrealEd, they have to be set from the <a href="../../../../articles/a/c/t/Legacy%7EActor_Classes_Browser_03a1.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Legacy:Actor Classes Browser">Actor Classes Browser</a> interface; hidden variables (not declared to show up in any of the property groups) can have their defaults set via the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/r/Legacy%7EUnrealEd_Console_a1ec.html" title="Legacy:UnrealEd Console">UnrealEd console</a>. Use <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/m/Legacy%7ECompiling_With_UCC_0337.html" title="Legacy:Compiling With UCC">UCC Make</a> instead of UnrealEd to compile your classes if you want to use this feature. This error can also happen when you use a weird commenting style like:
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="coMULTI">/* some comment
</span>
</pre></div>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><span class="coMULTI">/</span><span class="co1">//===========</span>Basically using a multi-line comment immediately followed by a single-line comment anywhere in your class breaks the parser and makes it complain about the defaultproperties keyword. Add a whitespace or linebreak or think about your commenting style in general.&#160;;)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Unexpected '<i>} or identifier</i>'&#160;</dt>
<dd>This is caused by one or more missing "<code>{</code>" or too many "<code>}</code>". See suggestions above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Call to '<i>function</i>': Type mismatch in parameter <i>number</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>One of the parameters in your function call doesn't have the right type and can't be automatically <a href="../../../../articles/t/y/p/Legacy%7ETypecasting_7c5f.html" title="Legacy:Typecasting">casted</a> to it. Look up the original declaration of the function (in the original UnrealScript source code or here on the Wiki) and double-check against the types of the values you're actually using.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Error, Call to '<i>function name</i>': bad or missing parameter 1</dt>
<dd>Due to Non-Existing Variable or Spelling mistake Example:
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
TriggerEvent<span class="br0">(</span><span class="st0">'SomethingWrongHere'</span>, <span class="kw8">Self</span>, Instigator<span class="br0">)</span>
</pre></div>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Error, Call to '<i>function name</i>': Bad ',' or missing ')'&#160;</dt>
<dd>This error is reported if you attempt to call a function with more parameters than it was declared with. In other words, there should be no comma where the compiler found it, maybe the call is simply missing a right parenthesis there. For example the <a href="../../../../articles/g/l/o/Legacy%7EGlobal_Function_3800.html" title="Legacy:Global Function">global function</a> <b>Atan</b> was defined with only one parameter in UT1, but with two parameters in later engine generations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Internal fixup error 0&#160;</dt>
<dd>This error occurs when using <code>break</code> in an <code>if</code> statement inside a <code>case</code> block.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>'Else': Bad command or expression&#160;</dt>
<dd>Make sure there is an <code>If</code> right before the mentioned <code>else</code>. If that <code>If</code> block executes more that one line of code, make sure the block is enclosed in braces. See <a href="../../../../articles/f/l/o/Legacy%7EFlow_Syntax_a7ce.html" title="Legacy:Flow Syntax">Flow Syntax</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Error, Bad or missing expression in '(some expression)'</dt>
<dd>Check whatever comes after the expression mentioned in the message. For example, a "Bad or missing expression in 'If'" could mean the condition does not evaluate to a boolean value (True or False), and generally you might have mistyped the function or variable name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Error, Right type is incompatable with "$"</dt>
<dd>Usually when you have only specified the name of an array and not the variable contained inside.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Error, Missing '(' in 'if'&#160;</dt>
<dd>Usually due to wrong operator eg. using If(a=b) instead of if(a==B).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Error,Missing '(' in 'struct'&#160;</dt>
<dd>Can be caused by leaving Blank spaces in a variable name inside a struct.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>'Else If' is not allowed here<br />
'Else' is not allowed here&#160;</dt>
<dd>Most likely you have the wrong number of braces after an <code>If</code> statement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>'class' is not allowed here&#160;</dt>
<dd>Generally caused by having your class statement in the wrong place. However, I got this error as well in a switch statement by putting something after default, like so:</dd>

    <span class="kw1">break</span>;
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
<dl>
<dt>Enum is not allowed here.&#160;</dt>
<dd>You have an enum declaration appearing after functions. Enums must be defined at the top of the class along with variables.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Bad variable or function '<i>name</i>' in replication definition&#160;</dt>
<dd>The variable or function isn't declared in this class. Check for spelling errors and make sure the specified variable or function isn't already declared in a superclass.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Error, 'class': Limitor '<i>name</i>' is not a class name&#160;</dt>
<dd>The <i>class name</i> in <tt>class&lt;<i>class name</i>&gt;</tt> does not point to an existing class. Make sure that the specified class is ed at the time the script is compiled.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Can't find Class '<i>class name</i>'&#160;</dt>
<dd>This error can also occur for <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/x/Legacy%7ETexture_7ee5.html" title="Legacy:Texture">Textures</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/s/o/u/Legacy%7ESound_ab57.html" title="Legacy:Sound">Sounds</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/s/Legacy%7EMesh_86f6.html" title="Legacy:Mesh">Meshes</a>, etc. Make sure the specified class is ed at compile time by either adding its package to the EditPackages <i>above</i> your package's entry or using an <code>#exec OBJ LOAD</code> line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>Package1.ClassName</i>'s superclass must be <i>Package1.SuperClassName</i>, not <i>Package2.SuperClassName</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>I got this weird error message when compiling two packages with similar class structures. <i>Package1</i> contained a class <i>ClassName</i> with the superclass <i>SuperClassName</i> (both in <i>Package1</i>) and <i>Package2</i> contained the same classes. <i>Package2</i> was compiled before <i>Package1</i> and the error occured during parsing of <i>ClassName</i> in <i>Package1</i>.<br />
Always change the class names when copying them from one project to another. It's fine as long as you compile them seperately, but as soon as you need both of them problems like this start occuring.<br />
<br />
<b>j3rky:</b> This error message also appears if you changed the ancestor class of native actors and objects (e.g. <i>class A extends B</i> changed to <i>class A extends C</i>), without having rebuilt the native DLL. In that case, the native DLL still references the old class <i>B</i> while the script compiler is trying to bind to the new class <i>C</i>. Fix this by deleting the old DLL, or by running <i>ucc make</i> with the <i>-nobind</i> option. Rebuild the DLL with the new generated header file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Unterminated string constant&#160;</dt>
<dd>This error occurs, when the closing double quotation marks for a string are missing. Note that while strings may contain line breaks, they may not span several lines in your code. Use the <code>Chr</code> function to generate the line break characters if you need them.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>fataoverdose</b>You can also get this error if you put one to many double quotation marks in the string.</p>
<dl>
<dt>BEGIN OBJECT: name <i>objectname</i> redefined.&#160;</dt>
<dd>This error occures if two or more objects declared in the <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/f/Legacy%7EDefault_Properties_bc11.html" title="Legacy:Default Properties">default properties</a> of the same class have the same name. The objects must have unique names.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>redundant data: <i>defaultproperty declaration</i>&#160;</dt>
<dd>You get this error when you redefine the default value of a property in the same class, like:

<dd>There's actually quite a string that acoompanies this, but this part should signal you that this is what you've got. You did something that the compiler can't handle but Epic never imagined you'd try. I got this error from trying to use an unconditional replication. I wanted this function to be replicated to the other party regardless of which machine it originated on, so I tried: reliable AddAction,RemoveAction; This will generate the above error. You MUST use the if part of the replication statement even if it will always be true. There isn't any way to know exactly what is causing this error in your code, but by looking at the ucc.log, you can at least determine which class the unexpected error was encountered (it will be the last class listed prior to the stack trace).

(IE you made a custom Material class and the package has a material of that class in it, and the code for that Material class hasn't been compiled yet) then the entire package will fail to.<br />
This can also happen if you have multiple paths, both containing the offending package. For example: let's say you have a texture package called mytex.utx, and for some reason you put it in your mod\textures\ directory, as well as your ut200x\system directory. You then add a texture to the copy in your mod\textures\ directory, and forget to add it to the other one(sloppy, but I've done this on accident before.) And let's say that in your .ini file you have your mod\textures\ directory listed AFTER the ut200x\textures directory. Then ucc will the first version of the package, thinking that's what you meant, but won't find the new texture, and spit this error at you. The solution: always only use one version of every package. Learn how to use ini files to tell UCC where to look for packages, rather than putting a copy in your mod directory to run, and your system directory to compile.<b>FatalOverdose</b>-note. one spelling mistake in a parent class can cause this error for all its children. This can be very frustrating when ucc tells you there are errors in scripts that seem to be totally correct. This can also occure if you try to put "new class'name'" in the defaultproperties.</dd>

<p>Tenative answer here... gurus feel free to confirm or deny this:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Variable is too large (xxx bytes, 255 max)</dt>
<dd><br />
These occur when you try to access a data structure that is greater then 255 bytes from another object.You might only be trying to access a little bool but if that bool is part of an array of structs whose total size is bigger than 255 bytes then you're not going to be able to code stuff like:</dd>
</dl>
<p>bMyvar = otheractor.bigarray[i].bTheirVar&#160;;</p>
<p>Without the compiler choking and giving that "context: variable is too large" error.</p>
<p>To work round this you can code a method into the object that contains the large structure that returns the element you're after (or, if the object is part of a package you can't recompile, then make a subclass and impliment the method there) like this:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="co1">// this is in the actor that contains the large array you need to access</span>

<span class="br0">}</span>
 
<span class="co1">// and this goes in the other object that's trying to access that data</span>
 
bMyvar=otheractor.<span class="me1">Checktheirvar</span><span class="br0">(</span>i<span class="br0">)</span>;
</pre></div>
<p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> afaik the <i>variable too large</i> only happens with static arrays and structs, so when you use dynamic arrays it won't happen. With dynamic arrays only a pointer it passed, while with static arrays and structs the whole array/struct will be passed. Yes dynamic arrays are slower, but with a big array it doesn't matter much.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Mychaeel:</b> "Dynamic arrays are slower"? Only if you count adding and removing elements, but that's plain impossible with static arrays. Accessing existing array elements is just as fast as with static arrays.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>JoeDark:</b> Accessing existing array elements in a dynamic array is only as fast as a static array if they are handled like Vectors in Java where it is actually a static array disguised as a dynamic array. If it's done as a linked list then access is O(n) compared to the static array's O(1) access time so static access is obviously faster, though unless your dealing with a large n not that much faster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Foxpaw:</b> Well, there's more than just two possible implementations of the dynamic arrays. The Unreal engine is chock full of caching schemes, tables, and other methods of storing and retrieving data that are far more complex than what one would generally assume of the implementation, and render speculation about the number of operations required for a given operation shaky at best. I wouldn't be surprised if static arrays and dynamic arrays are both stored in a relational database and looked up that way. The only way to really tell which is faster is to time them, but even that wouldn't really be accurate, because there's other stuff to consider.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For instance, if the implementation is as you suggested, (block of memory for array, linked list for dynamic arrays) then you would be doing a great number of operations on the stack. Anyways, I don't know how dynamic arrays or even static arrays are implemented in the Unreal Engine, but I'd question the notion that dynamic arrays are a linked list - because when you pass one to a function you get a duplicate array, not a pointer into an array.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>JoeDark:</b> Fair enough, esp. because uscript is an interpreted language arrays might be implemented any number of ways, including relational databases&#160;;)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Red:</b> I presume the issue is because of how the array is stored in memory. and because dynamic ones only pass a pointer rather than the whole array.still getting the infor be accessing with a method is one workable soultion, but i'm not sure if it would be faster than passing a pointer to a dynamic array.... both methods essentially allow you access the pieces of info you want, in sligthly different ways.</dd>

<p><b>Wormbo:</b> The error message itself doesn't help solving the problem. At least the WarthogHeadlight class' code should be posted, too.</p>
<p><b>Adam1972:</b> Actually, I've been hammering away at finding the answer... When I posted the problem I couldn't make</p>
<p>sense of what was happening... This is what I have so far.. I have a texture file called WHSkins.utx, and a mesh file</p>
<p>called WHMeshes.usx That I've created to replace the Bulldog textures and also A Warthog mesh from Halo to replace the</p>
<p>Warthog... So I assume I should be able to basically plug in the diffrences, at least to get it to go. When You look at</p>
<p>the Bulldog.uc ....</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw2">#exec</span> OBJ LOAD FILE=..\staticmeshes\BulldogMeshes.<span class="me1">usx</span>
<span class="kw2">#exec</span> OBJ LOAD FILE=..\sounds\WeaponSounds.<span class="me1">uax</span>
<span class="kw2">#exec</span> OBJ LOAD FILE=..\textures\VehicleFX.<span class="me1">utx</span>
</pre></div>
<p><b>Adam1972:</b> Then comparing it to my Warthog.uc:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw2">#exec</span> OBJ LOAD FILE=..\staticmeshes\WHMeshes.<span class="me1">usx</span>
<span class="kw2">#exec</span> OBJ LOAD FILE=..\sounds\WeaponSounds.<span class="me1">uax</span>
<span class="kw2">#exec</span> OBJ LOAD FILE=..\textures\WHSkins.<span class="me1">utx</span>
</pre></div>
<p><b>Adam1972:</b> You'll see I only changed the filename.. I followed the Instructions on compiling with UCC and figure that the directories inside the project should match what is listed in the UCC compiling page.. so I made a Halo directory and placed a Class, Textures, and Models folder inside. Umake begins to parse the files and when it hits the WarthogHeadlight.uc file which looks like this:</p>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" class="highlighted-source">
<pre class="source-uscript">
<span class="kw2">#exec</span> OBJ LOAD FILE=WHSkins.<span class="me1">utx</span>
 
<span class="kw5">class</span> WarthogHeadlight <span class="kw5">extends</span> DynamicProjector;
 
<span class="co1">// Empty tick here - do detach/attach in Warthog tick</span>
<span class="kw5">function</span> <span class="kw8">Tick</span><span class="br0">(</span><span class="kw4">float</span> Delta<span class="br0">)</span>
<span class="br0">{</span>
 
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It returns a WHSkins.utx not found. This script is exactly like the original BulldogHeadlight.uc script. I get the same</p>
<p>with the scripts calling on the WHMeshes.usx.</p>
<p>If I change it to #exec OBJ LOAD FILE=..\textures\WHSkins.utx it still does not find the files. If I place those same 2</p>
<p>files into the UT2003 folder in their respective folders.. Well that's when I get the "Script serialization mismatch"</p>
<p>error. I get no errors associated with the script itself, the only problem I found with that was the "defaultproperties"</p>
<p>that all the decompiled originals have.. my warthog ones seemed to cause errors until I deleted those "defaultproperties".</p>
<p>I'm stumped.... Please help&#160;:S</p>
<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I don't have UT2003 but I have found something that I think may be the problem. It doesn't surprise me that neither FILE=WHSkins.utx nor FILE=..\textures\WHSkins.utx finds the headlight. The former will look in the base directory of your class, the "Halo" directory, and the second goes up a step then looks in the base directory of your UT2003 install to find a package called "textures." Remember it starts from "Halo," not "Halo\classes." ".." means up one directory. What you need to put to reference "Halo\textures" is "FILE=.\textures\WHSkins.utx." Scratch the last dot, that's just for correct punctuation. ".." means go up one directory, "." means look in this directory. It's basically the same as writing "FILE=\textures\WHSkins.utx" except that the compiler won't accept that, so the single dot is used to denote a subdirectory of the one it starts in.</p>
<p><b>Languard:</b> Minor correction: UT2003 does accept "FILE=\textures\ect" I don't think having the current directory dot will hurt, but it isn't needed. Not on XP at least, it might be different for the other OS's. As a side note, I'm not sure why they the object files with exec statments, since it is not needed. I know this because for my sword attachment class, I use an animated mesh that I've placed in the Animations directory, but I do not have any exec statments to it, and it works fine. The only thing I can think of is maybe it is for performance reasons.</p>
<p><b>Languard:</b> Correction to previous satement, you do need the statments. My misconception was due to some really bad coding on my part, and I forgot about this one statement I had in a wierd spot. Yet another reason why you should always code neatly, even if it is throwaway code.</p>
<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Yes, I don't think you need the dots, the problem with the code that was listed was that it had a double dot and was going up one directory isntead of going fromt he current directory. You actually don't need the statements if you have the thing you were going to already in another package, so long as you refer to that package at compile-time. I never use statements and it works fine for me.</p>
<p><b>Lilguy:</b> just added some stuff to the "unresolved reference" error.</p>
<p><b>FatalOverdose</b> Added "just added 'Error, Bad or missing expression in 'If'". This a very usfull page but its getting to big.</p>
<p><b>Tarquin:</b> All the comments and chat need to be refactored into document mode. That would slim it down a bit!&#160;:)</p>
